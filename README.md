# Explore Event Logs in Minecraft
This project aims to display the results of process mining in the form of Minecraft maps compare them with traditional Petri net, and verify it has no deadlocks and "bounded" by "playing the token game".
We have covered some basic principles that make it straightforward to add 3D visualization based on Minecraft to a Petri net. Furthermore, no programming is required to create a graph. We support the Petri Net files with the format ".pnml" and ".xml" from Disco and ProM. This project could be reused to visualize Petri nets in Minecraft in 3D. The user only needs to select the appropriate file as input and immediately get a visual graph based on Minecraft map. Additionally, we provide information more than what it shows, i.e. the matrix from Fuzzy Miner. We visualize the frequency and mean duration with the height of the house and the color of the road, which will make stakeholders know the process better
